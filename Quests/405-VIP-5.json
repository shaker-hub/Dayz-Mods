    "I'm still shaky %1, but I'm safe now. i just want to go to your camp… it's a strange place, but it will be home for now. I owe a debt of gratitude to the one who found me. They risked their own safety to pull me from the wreckage, to bring me back to the others. I'm still trying to understand everything that happened, but I know this: I'm not alone anymore."
